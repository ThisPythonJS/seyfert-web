    **Breaking Changes:**
    - Channel threads are no longer part of the main cache; they are now merged with channels.
    - `WorkerAdapter` is no longer the default cache adapter of the WorkerClient.
    - Changed `Context.guild`, `Context.channel`, and `Context.me` functions to use the `flow` mode by default.
    - Removed `output` and `templates` locations from the configuration file.
    - Removed `updateOnly` parameter from the `patch` method in the cache Adapter.
    - Removed deprecated types and Intents.
    - Renamed `VoiceChannelMethods#setVoiceState` to `VoiceChannelMethods#setVoiceStatus`

    **Fixed:**
    - Fixed issues with zombie connections.
    - Fixed the `workerProxy` implementation in the `WorkerClient`.
    - Fixed `edit` method in `GuildRole`.
    - Fixed `ModalInteraction.member.roles` not returning the correct data.
    - Fixed collector `refresh` callback.
    - Fixed `guildMemberRemove` to get the correct `GuildMember` old object.

    **Additions:**
    - Added `Client.latency` to get the latency of all shards.
    - `cache.disabledCache` can now be a function that dynamically returns `true`/`false` based on the `cacheType` parameter.
    - Added `addRole` and `removeRole` methods to `BaseGuildMember`.
    - Enhanced the error message for "config file not found."
    - Component listeners now include an `onPass` function.
    - Added support for the Soundboard API with functionalities to `get`, `upload`, `list`, and `delete`.
    - Added a soundboard shorter in the `Client`.
    - Added custom events in the `WorkerClient`.
    - Introduced resharding, enabling automatic shard creation and deletion as needed in the WorkerClient.
    - `attachment` objects now support `ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8ClampedArray`, and `Uint8Array` (types updated).
    - `option.value` automatically infers the specified `option.choices` if available.
    - `options.value` now returns the same type as specified in the `option.channel_types`.
    - Introduced `Guild...Context` and `Context.inGuild()` to ensure guild data for commands not usable in DMs.
    - Added a `deferUpdate` method for `ComponentContext`s.
    - Embed setter methods (e.g., `addField`, `setDescription`) now support `undefined` as a valid parameter.
    - Seyfert configuration is now extendable using `ExtendedRC` for types and `ExtendedRCLocations` for `config.locations`.
    - Added a `generateOAuth2URL` utility in formatters.
    - Added support for Deno and Bun.
    - Introduced a shorter form for `voiceStates`, accessible via `client.voiceStates`.
    - Improved Discord API error messages.
    - Added an `onRatelimit` callback in ApiHandler (rest).
    - Added webhook event types for `applicationAuthorized`, `entitlementCreated`, and `questUserEnrollment`.
    - `HttpServerAdapter` now supports any type of `Client` (`HttpClient`, `Client`, or `WorkerClient`).
    - Added `channel.messages.list()` to fetch all messages in a channel.

    title="V2.1.0 Changes"
    date="September 7, 2024"
  >
    **Fixed:**
    - Handle http status 429 correctly (ratelimited)
    - Could not disable cache with `.setServices` in a `WorkerClient`

    **Additions:**
    - `EntryPointInteraction`, `ButtonPointContext`, `EntryPointCommand`
    - Resharding for `Client` (enabled by default)
    - `AnyContext` type
    - `WORKER_SHARD_CONNECTED` event
    - `SUBSCRIPTION_DELETE`, `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE`, `SUBSCRIPTION_CREATE`
    - Now shards logs errors without need of debug mode
    - Workers now have a queue to spawn

    **Breaking Changes:**

    - Interface `AttachmentData` changed property `name` to `ilename`
    ```ts del={2} ins={3}
    interface AttachmentData {
      name: string;
      filename: string;
    }
    ```

    - Now WorkerClient does not send all events to parent (WorkerManager) by default, if you want to enable it, just
    ```ts
    new WorkerClient({
        sendPayloadToParent: true
    });
    ```

    - `disabledCache` option in `WorkerClient` is not longer there, use `setServices` instead

    title="V2.0.0 Changes"

    With this version, we are proud to announce that seyfert now has 0 dependencies including a websocket client built from scratch.
  
    **Additions:**

    - **Handle commands**
    Now seyfert handle all commands across the same struct, if you use a custom argsParser o something check it, also, if you have a seyfert plugin or plan to make one, all seyfert structures are modifiable, so just point it where you want it to go.
    ```ts
    import { HandleCommand } from 'seyfert'

    client.setServices({ handleCommand: class extends HandleCommand { argsParser = yourParser() } })
    ```

    - **Transformers**
    Now seyfert allows you to transform discord data as you want,  seyfert will call it and use it in the whole library.
    ```ts
    import { Transformers } from 'seyfert';
    const storage = new Map();
    class MyPoll extends Poll {
        storage() {
            return storage.set(this.id, this);
        }
    }

    Transformers.Poll = (...args: ConstructorParameters<typeof MyPoll>) => new MyPoll(...args);

    declare module 'seyfert' {
        interface CustomStructures {
            Poll: MyPoll;
        }
    }
    ```

    - **Discord API**
    Now we support `Monetization`, `Polls (with builders)`, `Application Emojis`, `Get Role`, `Get voice states`, etc.

    **Little changes:**
    - Now disabledCaches options is a object
    - Some events cache bugs resolved
    - Fixed permissions bits resolved
