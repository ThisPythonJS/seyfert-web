## Updating Seyfert config

Having sent the component within a channel it's about time you want to handle the interaction from the component.

To handle them we have to tell seyfert where will be the components located in our project. We have to do this within our seyfert config file.

```ts twoslash title="seyfert.config.mjs" showLineNumbers copy ins={11}
// @ts-check
import { config } from "seyfert";

export default config.bot({
  token: process.env.BOT_TOKEN ?? "",
  intents: ["Guilds"],
  locations: {
    base: "dist",
    commands: "commands",
    events: "events",
    components: 'components'
  }
});
```

First of all we are going to create a file inside the directory which is set for the components.

Then we are going to create a class that extends [`ComponentCommand`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/components/componentcommand.ts#L14), something like what we do with commands, and then we are going to set the type of the component we want to handle (`Buttons` or whichever type of `SelectMenu`)


In this example I have created a component to reply `Hello World` to the interaction. I have set the customId of the button to `hello-world`.

```ts showLineNumbers copy

import { ComponentCommand } from 'seyfert';

export default class HelloWorldButton extends ComponentCommand {
    componentType = 'Button' as const;
}
```

## Filtering component interactions

Now we want the handler to handle only the interactions created by the `HelloWorld` button so we will use the customId we have to set in all the components.

To filter the interactions we are using a function inherited by the `ComponentCommand` class in which we have to return a boolean.

```ts ins={6-10} showLineNumbers copy

import { ComponentCommand, type ComponentContext } from 'seyfert';

export default class HelloWorldButton extends ComponentCommand {
  componentType = 'Button' as const;

  filter(ctx: ComponentContext<typeof this.componentType>) {
    //we are checking if the customId of the interaction is the same that the one set in my button

    return ctx.customId === 'hello-world';
  }
}
```

## Running the component handler

If the filter function success and returns `true` the handler will then execute a `run` function with your code logic.

```ts twoslash ins={14-19} showLineNumbers copy

import { ComponentCommand, type ComponentContext } from 'seyfert';

import { MessageFlags } from 'seyfert/lib/types';

export default class HelloWorldButton extends ComponentCommand {
  componentType = 'Button' as const;

  //this can be a promise too.

  filter(ctx: ComponentContext<typeof this.componentType>) {
    return ctx.customId === 'hello-world';
  }

  async run(ctx: ComponentContext<typeof this.componentType>) {
    return ctx.write({
      content: 'Hello World ðŸ‘‹',
      flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral
    });
  }
}

```
