# Sharding

:::note
By default, seyfert does sharding internally, this section tries to explain other methods and how to do it manually and/or with further optimizations.
:::

In seyfert the sharding approach is to give the full benefit of scaling while keeping the same structure in your project.

## Why sharding?

JavaScript runtimes are single-threaded, which means that without sharding, all processing would happen in a single thread. This creates a processing limit where all the load is evaluated together. Seyfert handles sharding internally in the `Client` instance to help distribute this load across multiple processes or threads (although it is still an imperfect technique).

## Managing shards

The base of the `Worker` is to allow to execute code in parallel in different parts of the CPU, either in threads or different processes. In terms of discord, this means the ability to connect several `shards` by spreading the load on each `Worker`, for seyfert this is just changing the `mode` property in the `WorkerManager` to decide the execution mode between `threads` to `spawn` clients on processor threads or `cluster` to `spawn` clients on different processes of the runtime.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label='manager.ts'>
```ts twoslash showLineNumbers
import { WorkerManager } from 'seyfert';

const manager = new WorkerManager({
	mode: "threads",
	// ./src/client.ts for bun and deno (?
	path: "./dist/client.js",
	// you can override a lot of options, like number of workers, shards per worker...
});

manager.start();
```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='client.ts'>
```ts twoslash showLineNumbers
import { ParseClient, WorkerClient } from "seyfert";

const client = new WorkerClient();

client.start();

declare module 'seyfert' {
	interface UsingClient extends ParseClient<WorkerClient> {}
}
```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Too simple? Seyfert takes care of all the logic so your project shouldn't change much just by switching to a `WorkerSharding`.

## Cache
Unlike traditional Discord libraries, Seyfert offers unified cache management across all shards. The cache can be centralized in the main process (the `WorkerManager` executor), ensuring consistent data access throughout your application. 

To implement centralized caching, use the WorkerAdapter:

```ts twoslash
import { WorkerClient, WorkerAdapter } from 'seyfert';

const client = new WorkerClient();

client.setServices({
	cache: {
		adapter: new WorkerAdapter(client.workerData)
	}
});

await client.start();
```

## Talking to other workers
If for some reason (I did not find any for the example), you want a specific worker to execute an action that another one received, you can simply ask it.

```ts twoslash
import { WorkerClient } from 'seyfert';
const client = new WorkerClient();
//---cut---
client.tellWorker(
	1,
	(worker, vars) => console.log(`Hii worker #${worker.workerId} from ${vars.workerId}`),
	{ workerId: client.workerId }
);
```
