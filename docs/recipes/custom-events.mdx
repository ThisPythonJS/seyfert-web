title: Custom Events

:::tip
As in other sections, [module augmentation](/getting-started/declare-module) will be used, we recommend reading it first.
:::

Seyfert allows to load, integrate and execute custom "events" to be called anywhere, for the sake of this example an simple event will be created called <a href="https://cdn-useast1.kapwing.com/static/templates/our-meme-template-regular-50760e0b.webp" target="_blank">`ourEvent`</a>.

:::note
If two events have the same name, they will be overwritten.

## Integrating

First we need to let know Seyfert typing system that we will have an custom event.

```ts title="index.ts"
declare module "seyfert" {
	interface CustomEvents {
		ourEvent: (text: string) => void;
	}
}
```

### Loading event

This is just here to flex that you don't have to do anything, just put your events in the designated folder in `seyfert.config`.

```ts
import { createEvent } from 'seyfert';

export default createEvent({
	data: { name: "ourEvent", once: false },
	run: (text) => {
		console.log(text);
	}
});
```

### Executing

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Client } from "seyfert";

const client = new Client();

(async () => {
	await client.start();
	client.events?.runCustom('ourEvent', 'Hello, world!');
})();

declare module "seyfert" {
	interface CustomEvents {
		ourEvent: (text: string) => void;
	}
}
```

After running the code, you should see `Hello, world!` in the console. That's it!
