description: An introduction on how to deploy Seyfert in a Docker container
---

This guide assumes you have knowledge of the following topics:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization)

## Why Docker?

Docker provides a consistent environment that ensures the correct operation of any bot in both development and production, as well as simplifying workflow by integrating with CI/CD tools.

With Docker, scaling a bot horizontally is simple, allowing workloads to be distributed across multiple instances as needed.

## What files does a Seyfert project need?

There are four files we need:

- `package.json`: support for JavaScript modules
- `seyfert.config.mjs`: configurations for Seyfert
- `/node_modules`: dependencies
- `/src` or `/dist`: application entry point

## Deploying with Node.js

### Dockerfile for a TypeScript project

The example `Dockerfile` assumes the following about your project:

- It has the following *npm scripts*:
    - `start`: runs the application's entry point
    - `build`: transpiles TypeScript code to JavaScript

```docker title="Dockerfile" copy
FROM node:<VERSION_TAG>

WORKDIR /project

COPY package*.json ./

# Ref: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-ci
RUN npm ci

COPY tsconfig.json ./
COPY seyfert.config.mjs ./
COPY /src ./src

# Ref: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-prune
RUN npm run build && \
    npm prune --production

ENV USER node
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Restrict user permissions in production
USER $USER

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

You must replace `<VERSION_TAG>` with the Node.js version you want to use.

### With Multi-stage builds

While the previous image is functional, it's not very optimal or secure. The following example uses `multi-stage builds` and `dumb-init`:

```docker title="Dockerfile" copy
# Base stage
FROM node:<VERSION_TAG>-alpine<ALPINE_VERSION> AS base

ENV DIR /project
WORKDIR $DIR

# Build stage
FROM base AS build

# Ref: https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache dumb-init

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm ci

COPY tsconfig.json ./
COPY seyfert.config.mjs ./
COPY /src ./src

RUN npm run build && \
    npm prune --production

# Production stage
FROM base AS production

COPY --from=build /usr/bin/dumb-init /usr/bin/dumb-init
COPY --from=build $DIR/node_modules $DIR/node_modules
COPY --from=build $DIR/dist $DIR/dist
COPY --from=build $DIR/package.json $DIR/package.json
COPY --from=build $DIR/seyfert.config.mjs $DIR/seyfert.config.mjs

ENV USER node
ENV NODE_ENV=production

USER $USER

CMD ["dumb-init", "node", "dist/index.js"]
```
