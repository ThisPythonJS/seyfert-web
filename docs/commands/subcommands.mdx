title: Sub-Zero (Sub Commands)

import { FileTree, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

We’ve covered the basics of creating a command, but what if we want to create a command that has subcommands? For example, we want to create a command with a `create` subcommand and a `delete` subcommand. This is where subcommands come into play.

## Creating a Subcommand

To create a subcommand, we need to create a new class that extends `SubCommand` and implement the `run` method. Then, we need to add the subcommand to the main command.

Let’s assume you have the following directory structure:

<FileTree>
- src
 - commands
	- account
	 	- create.command.ts
	 	- delete.command.ts
	 	- parent.ts
 - index.ts
- seyfert.config.mjs
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label='parent.ts' icon="seti:typescript">

With this file structure, you can use `@Autoload()` and Seyfert will automatically add the commands for you.
But make sure to export the subcommands by default.

:::


```ts copy
import { Declare, Command, Options } from "seyfert";
import { CreateCommand } from "./create.command";
import { DeleteCommand } from "./delete.command";

@Declare({
	name: "account",
	description: "account command"
})
// Being in the same folder with @AutoLoad() you can save this step
@Options([CreateCommand, DeleteCommand])
export default class AccountCommand extends Command {}

```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='create.command.ts' icon="seti:typescript">
	
```ts copy
import { type CommandContext, Declare, SubCommand } from "seyfert";

@Declare({
	name: "create",
	description: "create a new something"
})
export class CreateCommand extends SubCommand {
	run(ctx: CommandContext) {
		// some logic here

		return ctx.write({
			content: "create command executed"
		});
	}
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='delete.command.ts' icon="seti:typescript">
```ts copy
import { type CommandContext, Declare, SubCommand } from "seyfert";

@Declare({
	name: "delete",
	description: "delete something"
})
export class DeleteCommand extends SubCommand {
	run(ctx: CommandContext) {
		// some logic here

		return ctx.write({
			content: "delete command executed"
		});
	}
}
```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the example above, we created a `create` subcommand and a `delete` subcommand. Then, we added the subcommands to the main command using the `@Options` decorator.

:::note
Note that we essentially treat the subcommand as an option of the main command. (In fact, this is how Discord handles subcommands too)

## Subcommand Groups  

For a more divided structure, you can create groups for subcommands using the `@Group` and `@Groups` decorators in the main command.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="parent.ts">

```ts twoslash copy
// @noErrors
import { Command, Declare, Options, Groups } from 'seyfert';
import MySubCommand from './sub';

@Declare({
    name: 'parent',
    description: 'My main command',
})
@Options([MySubCommand])
@Groups({
    'my-group': {
        defaultDescription: 'A subcommand group',
    }
})
export default class ParentCommand extends Command {}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="mygroup-sub.ts">

```ts twoslash
import { SubCommand, Declare, CommandContext, Group } from 'seyfert';

@Declare({
    name: 'subcommand',
    description: 'One of my subcommands within the my-group group',
})
@Group('my-group')
export default class GroupMySubCommand extends SubCommand {
    run(ctx: CommandContext) {
        return ctx.write({
            content: 'Hello from the subcommand!',
        });
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
