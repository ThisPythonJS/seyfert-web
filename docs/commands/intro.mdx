title: Introduction to Commands

import { FileTree, TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The primary entry point for any Discord bot is commands. In Seyfert, commands are defined using TypeScript decorators, making it easier to specify their properties, options, middlewares, and subcommands.  

:::note  
If you havenâ€™t created [your first command](../getting-started/first-command) yet, please refer to that introductory guide before proceeding.

## Declaring a Command  

All commands in Seyfert are class-based, and each class extends the base **`Command`** class.  

Additionally, the **name** and **description** are mandatory properties for every command. Below is a list of possible properties that can be used with the `@Declare` decorator:

```ts twoslash
import { Declare, Command, IgnoreCommand } from 'seyfert';

@Declare({
    name: 'your-command',
    description: 'A description for this command',
    // Properties to pass as metadata
    props: {},

    // List of permissions required by the member
    defaultMemberPermissions: ['Administrator'],

    // List of permissions required by the bot
    botPermissions: ['ManageGuild'],

    // List of server IDs to register the command
    guildId: ['100000'],

    // Determines if the command is NSFW
    nsfw: false,

    // List of alternate names for the command (text commands)
    aliases: ['an-alias'],

    // Identifies the installation types the command supports,
    //   default is server-only
    integrationTypes: ['GuildInstall', 'UserInstall'],

    // Specifies where a command can be used
    contexts: ['BotDM', 'Guild', 'PrivateChannel'],

    // Defines whether to ignore the execution of the command in slash
    //   or text-message versions
    ignore: IgnoreCommand.Slash,
    //                    ^|

    // Sets the type of command:
    /// type: ApplicationCommandType.User
})
class MyCommand extends Command {}
```
