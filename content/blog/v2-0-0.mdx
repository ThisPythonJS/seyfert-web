title: Seyfert v2.0.0
description: Major release with zero dependencies and new features
date: 2024-08-23
---

We are proud to announce that Seyfert now has zero dependencies, including a WebSocket client built from scratch!

## New Features

### Handle Commands
Now Seyfert handles all commands across the same struct. If you use a custom argsParser or plan to make a Seyfert plugin, all Seyfert structures are modifiable.

```ts
import { HandleCommand } from 'seyfert'

client.setServices({ handleCommand: class extends HandleCommand { argsParser = yourParser() } })
```

### Transformers
Seyfert now allows you to transform Discord data as you want. Seyfert will call it and use it throughout the library.

```ts
import { Transformers } from 'seyfert';
const storage = new Map();
class MyPoll extends Poll {
    storage() {
        return storage.set(this.id, this);
    }
}

Transformers.Poll = (...args: ConstructorParameters<typeof MyPoll>) => new MyPoll(...args);

declare module 'seyfert' {
    interface CustomStructures {
        Poll: MyPoll;
    }
}
```

### Discord API Support
We've added support for:
- Monetization
- Polls (with builders)
- Application Emojis
- Get Role
- Get voice states
- And more!

## Changes

- `disabledCaches` option is now an object
- Fixed several events cache bugs
- Fixed permissions bits resolution
