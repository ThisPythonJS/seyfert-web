## Breaking Changes

- `PermissionsBitField.has` now expects an array
- `set`, `parse`, and `onFile` now expects `LangInstance` instead of `EventInstance`
- Changed all `method(force?: boolean)` to `method(mode: 'cache' | 'rest' | 'flow')`
- Changed `getAnswerVoters` to accept an optional parameter for client-side checking if the answer exists
