## Bug Fixes

- Handle http status 429 correctly (ratelimited)
- Could not disable cache with `.setServices` in a `WorkerClient`

## New Features

- Added `EntryPointInteraction`, `ButtonPointContext`, `EntryPointCommand`
- Resharding for `Client` (enabled by default)
- Added `AnyContext` type
- Added `WORKER_SHARD_CONNECTED` event
- Added `SUBSCRIPTION_DELETE`, `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE`, `SUBSCRIPTION_CREATE` events
- Now shards logs errors without need of debug mode
- Workers now have a queue to spawn

## Breaking Changes

- Interface `AttachmentData` changed property `name` to `filename`:
```ts
interface AttachmentData {
  - name: string;
  + filename: string;
}
```

- WorkerClient no longer sends all events to parent (WorkerManager) by default. To enable it:
```ts
new WorkerClient({
    sendPayloadToParent: true
});
```

- `disabledCache` option in `WorkerClient` has been removed, use `setServices` instead
